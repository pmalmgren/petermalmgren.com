## About me

I'm a dad and software engineer. I live in the mountains of North Carolina, and am currently working at Zapier.

In 2021, I did a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I've learned a lot about [compilers, networking, and Rust](/categories/recurse-center-2021/).

When I'm not parenting or working I enjoy hiking, reading, podcasts, learning, lifting weights, cooking, and occasionally writing on this blog.

## About this site

Technologies used to build the site:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/pmalmgren/petermalmgren.com) to host the code
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static site generator written in Go
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host my site and deploy it automatically from GitHub

I used to use Google Analytics, but I stopped in favor of [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/), which is a privacy-focused analytics tool that doesn't collect any personal information about you.
