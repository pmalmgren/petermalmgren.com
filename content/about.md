## About this site

Technologies used to build the site:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/pmalmgren/petermalmgren.com) to host the code
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static site generator written in Go
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host my site and deploy it automatically from GitHub
- [neovim](https://neovim.org) to write the content

I used to use Google Analytics, but I stopped in favor of [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/), which is a privacy-focused analytics tool that doesn't collect any personal information about you.

## About me

I'm a dad and [software engineer](https://github.com/pmalmgren). I live in the mountains of North Carolina, and am currently doing a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I'm learning about [compilers, networking, and Rust](/categories/recurse-center-2021/).

I've worked for a [few other organizations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ptmalmgren/), but the work I'm most proud of is the time I spent working as a senior backend engineer at [Zapier](https://zapier.com).

When I'm not parenting or working I enjoy hiking, reading, podcasts, learning, lifting weights, cooking, and occasionally writing on this blog.

## Getting in touch

There are several ways to reach me, but the best is probably via a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ptmalmgren).

You can try [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ptmalmgren/), but I rarely check that.
